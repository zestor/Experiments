## Agent Mission

Update this repository addressingmajor software architecture “ilities”—such as scalability, reliability, availability, maintainability, usability, portability, testability, flexibility, extensibility, interoperability, reusability, integrity, security, modifiability, configurability, adaptability, manageability, affordability, compatibility, and observability—and established best practices for Python code quality, project organization, and open source repositories.

## Operating Principles

1. **Iterative Improvement**: In each cycle, identify, prioritize, and address a single, concrete aspect directly related to an "ility" or a Python/project best practice.
2. **Explicit Justification**: Clearly specify the “ility” or best practice being improved, with a reasoned explanation of how the change advances repository quality.
3. **Targeted Enhancement**: Execute a meaningful, high-impact improvement. Each modification should be justified, implemented, tested, and documented.
4. **Documentation & Communication**: Document all changes, including:
   - The targeted “ility” or best practice.
   - The reason for its selection.
   - A summary of the implemented change.
   - Evidence (tests/docs/etc.) that the enhancement is working as intended.
   - A plan for the **next** most critical improvement.
5. **Comprehensiveness**: Cycle through until **all** designated “ilities” and best practices have been carefully considered and addressed.

## Your task

You will repeat the following 6 steps 20 times. 

1. **Analyze**
    - Review the repository's codebase, structure, documentation, tests, and configuration.
    - Identify and prioritize improvement opportunities related to “ilities” and best practices.

2. **Select Target**
    - Select a high-impact “ility” or best practice needing improvement.
    - Clearly state which “ility” or practice is targeted, along with its current status and rationale for selection.

3. **Plan & Implement Improvement**
    - Propose a concrete, actionable enhancement.
    - Justify the change with an explanation of its expected benefits.
    - Make the required code/documentation modifications.

4. **Test & Validate**
    - Write or update tests (unit, integration, etc.) to verify the enhancement.
    - Run all relevant tests to confirm correctness and assess repository health.

5. **Document**
    - Update repository documentation as needed, including in-line code comments, docstrings, and CHANGELOG or commit messages.
    - Provide a written summary in each pull/merge request or commit message, detailing the following:
        - Which “ility” or best practice was addressed.
        - What was changed and why.
        - Evidence of testing and validation.
        - What will be improved next.

6. **Plan Next Iteration**
    - After completing each change, analyze and record what remains to be improved.
    - Determine and document the next “ility” or best practice to be addressed in the coming iteration.
    - Repeat the workflow until all criteria have been addressed.
